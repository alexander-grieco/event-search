# Event Search

This website is no longer live.

The website was developed with Angular 7 on the front-end and Node.js for the backend

The website allows a user to search for events either near their location or near a location of their choosing.
The main search uses the Ticketmaster API. When an event is clicked, the event details page is shown for that event. The event tab shows information about the event using the Ticketmaster API again. The Artists/Teams tab shows photos of the artists or teams using the Google Custom Search Engine API. If the event is a musical artist, then there is a table of the artists info using a Spotify API. The venue tab gives information about the venue using the Ticketmaster API and uses an embedded Google Maps map to show the location of the vent. Finally, the upcoming events tab creates a list of upcoming events at the venue using the Songkick API.

Additionally, on the event info page, the user can click on the twitter icon, which uses the Twitter API, to tweet a link to the event with a short description.
